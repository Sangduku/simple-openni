= Introduction =

The build system is based on CMake, so it should be easy to build the project on your platform.

= Preparation =

Before you can build the library you should install following tools:
  * [http://www.openni.org/ OpenNI + NITE]
  * [https://cds.sun.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/WFS/CDS-CDS_Developer-Site/en_US/-/USD/ViewProductDetail-Start?ProductRef=jdk-6u24-oth-JPR@CDS-CDS_Developer Java Development Kit] (should be installed on OSX)
  * [http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html CMake]
  * [http://www.swig.org/download.html Swig] >= *v2.0.2*
  * [http://eigen.tuxfamily.org Eigen] >= *v3.0*
  * [http://www.boost.org/ Boost] >= *v1.46* (use the static build)
Boost build tips for OSX(32/64bit version):
{{{
> cd boost_folderXY
> sudo ./bjam link=static architecture=x86 address-model=32_64 install
}}}
Boost build tips for Linux(64bit version):
{{{
> cd boost_folderXY
> ./bjam link=static cxxflags=-fPIC
}}}
I did run into troubles with the shared lib version of boost and the static lib version. Also i did get problems when i linked the static lib version to SimpleOpenNI without the -fPIC flag.

----
= Windows =

On windows i only used Visual Studio 2008
  * Download the souces from the svn
  * Open a terminal and go into the 'SimpleOpenNI' folder
  * Type those commands:
{{{
> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake -DEIGEN3D_INCLUDE='path to the Eigen folder' -DBOOST_ROOT='path to the Boost folder' ..
}}}
  * Now you should find in the 'SimpleOpenNI/build' folder the Visual Studio Projectfile
  * Open 'SimpleOpenNI.sln' and build it
----
= OSX 32/64bit =

On OSX you need [http://developer.apple.com/technologies/xcode.html Xcode] in order to compile the sources. Processing should be installed in the applications-folder.

  * Download the souces from the svn
  * Open a terminal and go into the 'SimpleOpenNI' folder
  * Change the paths to your local ones in those two files:  buildOsx.sh, installOsx.sh (There is more info in the files)
  * Type those commands:
{{{
> ./buildOsx.sh
> ./installOsx.sh
}}}
----
= UNIX/Linux =

  * Download the souces from the svn
  * Open a terminal and go into the 'SimpleOpenNI' folder
  * Change the paths to your local ones in those two files:  buildLinux64.sh or buildLinux32, installLinux.sh (There is more info in the files)
  * Type those commands:
{{{
> ./buildOsx.sh
> ./installOsx.sh
}}}
