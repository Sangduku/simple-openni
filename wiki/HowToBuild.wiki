= Introduction =

The build system is based on CMake, so it should be easy to build the project on your platform.

----
= Preparation =

Before you can build the library you should install following tools:
  * [http://www.openni.org/ OpenNI + NITE]
  * [https://cds.sun.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/WFS/CDS-CDS_Developer-Site/en_US/-/USD/ViewProductDetail-Start?ProductRef=jdk-6u24-oth-JPR@CDS-CDS_Developer Java Development Kit] (should be installed on OSX)
  * [http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html CMake]
  * [http://www.swig.org/download.html Swig] >= *v2.0.2*
  * [http://eigen.tuxfamily.org Eigen] >= *v3.0*
  * [http://www.boost.org/ Boost] >= *v1.46*
----
= Windows =

On windows i only used Visual Studio 2008
  * Download the souces from the svn
  * Open a terminal and go into the 'SimpleOpenNI' folder
  * Type those commands:
{{{
> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake -DEIGEN3D_INCLUDE=C:/'path to the Eigen folder' ..
}}}
  * Now you should find in the 'SimpleOpenNI/build' folder the Visual Studio Projectfile
  * Open 'SimpleOpenNI.sln' and build it
----
= OSX =

On OSX you need [http://developer.apple.com/technologies/xcode.html Xcode] in order to compile the sources. Processing should be installed in the applications-folder.

  * Download the souces from the svn
  * Open a terminal and go into the 'SimpleOpenNI' folder
  * Type those commands:
{{{
> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake -DXN_NITE_INCLUDE=/usr/include/nite -DXN_NITE_LIB=/usr/lib \
-DEIGEN3D_INCLUDE=/usr/local/include/eigen3 ..
> make
}}}
----
= UNIX/Linux =

  * Download the souces from the svn
  * Open a terminal and go into the 'SimpleOpenNI' folder
  * Type those commands:
{{{
> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake -DOPEN_NI_INCLUDE=/usr/include/ni -DOPEN_NI_LIB=/usr/lib \
-DXN_NITE_INCLUDE=/usr/include/nite -DXN_NITE_LIB=/usr/lib \
-DP5_JAR='your path to the processing folder'/processing-1.2.1/lib/core.jar \
-DEIGEN3D_INCLUDE=/usr/local/include/eigen3 ..
> make
}}}
