#summary Build instructions

= Introduction =

The build system is based on CMake, so it should be easy to build the project on your platform.

 * [HowToBuild#UNIX/Linux UNIX/Linux]
----
= Preparation =

Before you can build the library you should install following tools:
  * [https://cds.sun.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/WFS/CDS-CDS_Developer-Site/en_US/-/USD/ViewProductDetail-Start?ProductRef=jdk-6u24-oth-JPR@CDS-CDS_Developer Java Development Kit] (should be installed on OSX)
  * [http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html CMake]
  * [http://www.swig.org/download.html Swig] >= *v2.0.2*
  * [http://eigen.tuxfamily.org Eigen] >= *v3.0*
----
= Windows =

On windows i only used Visual Studio 2008
  * Download the souces from the svn
  * On Windows i use the CMake-Gui
  * Set sourcecode folder to your ..SimpleOpenNI location
  * Set the binaries folder to ..SimpleOpenNI/vc
  * Configure and add an entry 'EIGEN3D_INCLUDE' to the folder where you have installed Eigen
  * Select Visual Studio 2008(64Bit will not work, because the OpenNI libs are 32Bit)
  * Now you have a Visual Studio Project 'SimpleOpenNI.sln'
----

= OSX =

On OSX you need [http://developer.apple.com/technologies/xcode.html Xcode] in order to compile the sources. Processing should be installed in the applications-folder.

  * Download the souces from the svn
  * Open a terminal and go into the 'SimpleOpenN' folder
  * Type those commands:
{{{
> cmake .
> make
}}}
----
= UNIX/Linux =

  * Download the souces from the svn
  * Open a terminal and go into the 'SimpleOpenN' folder
  * Type those commands:
{{{
> cmake -DOPEN_NI_INCLUDE=/usr/include/ni -DOPEN_NI_LIB=/usr/lib \
-DXN_NITE_INCLUDE=/usr/include/nite -DXN_NITE_LIB=/usr/lib \
-DP5_JAR=/home/max/app/processing-1.2.1/lib/core.jar \
-DEIGEN3D_INCLUDE=/usr/local/include/eigen3 .
> make
}}}
