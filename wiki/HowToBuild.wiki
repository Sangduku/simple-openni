= Preparation =

Before you can build the library you should install following tools:
  * [https://cds.sun.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/WFS/CDS-CDS_Developer-Site/en_US/-/USD/ViewProductDetail-Start?ProductRef=jdk-6u24-oth-JPR@CDS-CDS_Developer Java Development Kit] (should be installed on OSX)
  * [http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html CMake]
  * [http://www.swig.org/download.html Swig] >= *v2.0.2*

  * Now you have a Visual Studio Project 'SimpleOpenNI.sln'
