Before you can use SimpleOpenNI you have to install OpenNI. This can take quite some time on some platforms.

Install Primesense Driver (Asus Xtion Pro, etc.)
  * Download and install [http://www.openni.org/downloadfiles/openni-compliant-hardware-binaries/31-latest-unstable Primesensor]
Install Kinect Driver
  * Download [https://github.com/avin2/SensorKinect SensorKinect], unzip it and open the file at `/avin2/SensorKit/SensorKinect-Win-OpenSource32-?.?.?.msi`

If everything worked out, you should see the camera in your Device Manager(under PrimeSensor : Kinect Camera, Kinect Motor).

  * Copy the 'SimpleOpenNI.zip' into this folder:
      C:\Users\'your username'\Documents\Processing\libraries

= OSX =

I made a little installer(see Install OpenNI the short way), if this doesn't work for you, than you should install it the offical way. For my tests i used only OSX 10.6., with 10.5 i had some problems.

* Install OpenNI the short way (OpenNI v1.1.0.41 and NITE v1.3.1.5) *
  * Download the [http://code.google.com/p/simple-openni/downloads/detail?name=OpenNI_NITE_Installer-OSX-0.20.zip&can=2&q=#makechanges Installer]
  * Unzip the file and open a terminal window
  * Go to the unzipped folder 'OpenNI_NITE_Installer-OSX'
{{{
> cd ./OpenNI_NITE_Installer-OSX 
}}}
  * Start the installer
{{{
> sudo ./install.sh
}}}
